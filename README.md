cd ~/.n8n/custom

# Install the node
npm install n8n-nodes-mindsurf
```

### Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dandacompany/n8n-nodes-mindsurf.git

# Install dependencies
cd n8n-nodes-mindsurf
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers
npm run install-browsers

# Build the node
npm run build

# Link for local development
npm link

# In your n8n installation
cd ~/.n8n/custom
npm link n8n-nodes-mindsurf
```

## Usage

1. Add the **Mindsurf** node to your workflow
2. Select a browser (Chromium, Firefox, or WebKit)
3. Choose an operation category
4. Select the specific operation
5. Configure the operation parameters
6. Optionally set browser options (headless mode, viewport size, etc.)
7. Use a Session ID to reuse browser contexts across node executions

### Example: Take a Screenshot

```json
{
  "browser": "chromium",
  "category": "navigation",
  "navigationOperation": "goto",
  "url": "https://example.com"
}
```

Then add another Mindsurf node:

```json
{
  "browser": "chromium",
  "category": "screenshot",
  "screenshotOperation": "screenshot",
  "screenshotOptions": {
    "fullPage": true,
    "type": "png"
  }
}
```

### Session Management

#### Basic Session Management
Use the Session ID parameter to maintain browser state across multiple node executions. This allows you to:
- Keep login sessions active
- Reuse the same browser context
- Maintain cookies and local storage
- Improve performance by avoiding repeated browser launches

#### Login Session Persistence
Save and restore login sessions to skip repetitive authentication:

1. **Save Login Session** - After logging in:
```json
{
  "browser": "chromium",
  "category": "session",
  "sessionOperation": "saveSession",
  "profileName": "My Gmail Account",
  "profileDescription": "Personal Gmail with 2FA"
}
```

2. **Load Saved Session** - Restore login state later:
```json
{
  "browser": "chromium",
  "category": "session",
  "sessionOperation": "loadSession",
  "profileId": "profile_123456789",
  "createNewSession": true
}
```

3. **Manage Saved Sessions**:
- List all saved sessions: `sessionOperation: "listSavedSessions"`
- Delete a saved session: `sessionOperation: "deleteSavedSession"`

Saved sessions are stored locally in `~/.n8n/mindsurf-profiles/` and include:
- Cookies
- Local Storage
- Session Storage
- Authentication tokens

## Browser Options

Configure browser behavior with these options:
- **Headless**: Run browser without GUI
- **Viewport**: Set browser window dimensions
- **User Agent**: Custom user agent string
- **Locale & Timezone**: Emulate different regions
- **Permissions**: Grant specific browser permissions
- **Network**: Set proxy, offline mode, HTTP credentials
- **JavaScript**: Enable/disable JavaScript execution

## Requirements

- n8n version 0.170.0 or higher
- Node.js 16.x or higher
